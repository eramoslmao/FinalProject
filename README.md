# FinalProject
This code is to be used by
construction managers who wish
to find aid for cost estimation
by looking through databases of
values and be able to get quick and easy cost totals for all their materials and labor costs. It will require multiple runs for multiple outputs. Answer the prompts and please remember that your answers are **case sensitive**
Upon first run, the source code will create all the labor and steel databases with names, descriptions and prices. In the test code you will see the user interface, where the program will run the user along, asking them for values to be predetermined before any calculation. It will then give the user the choice of which topic to calculate, concrete material, wood material, steel material, or labor. Once selected the user will end up with a subtotal of cost for the material. With the case of steel and labor, the program will allow the user to choose from the database and calculate their subtotal after the choice.
